The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2024-08-31

### Fixed
- **Breaking**: Fixed environment variable initialization issue that caused `ConfigurationError` at import time
- Implemented lazy loading for TestRail configuration to prevent errors when importing the library without environment variables set
- Environment variables are now validated only when `updateTestResult()` is called, not at module import time

### Technical Changes
- Moved environment variable validation from constructor to private `initialize()` method
- Added lazy initialization pattern to `TestRailHelper` class
- Maintained backward compatibility - no API changes required for existing users

## [1.1.0] - 2024-08-31

- New Playwright converter utility (`src/utils/playwright-converter.ts`)
- Playwright integration example (`src/examples/playwright-integration.example.ts`)
- Section IDs example (`src/examples/section-ids.example.ts`)
- Worker manager for better parallel execution handling (`src/managers/worker-manager.ts`)
- Environment variables documentation (`ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`)
- Setup documentation (`SETUP.md`)

- Improved test case manager with better error handling
- Enhanced test run manager with more robust coordination
- Updated validation utilities with additional checks
- Better TypeScript type definitions and exports
- Improved constants management

### Technical Improvements
